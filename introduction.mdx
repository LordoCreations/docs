<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="FTC Robot Controller" defaultOpen={false}>
    The [FTC Robot Controller](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController) is the software that runs on a [REV Control Hub](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1595/) or FTC Robot Controller App. By adding TeleOp or Autonomous "OpModes", software allows FTC Robots to do various player-controller or autonomous functions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Android Studio" defaultOpen={false}>
    [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) is a version of [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) by [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) designed for creating Android Apps, and is also the preferred IDE for FTC programming.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gradle" defaultOpen={false}>
    [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is a build automation tool that is used to build and launch the FTC RC to the Robot Controller. Currently, the FTC RC uses Gradle 7.2.0. This means that the Java version needs to be set to Java 17. However, FTC does plan to upgrade to a higher version of Gradle soon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="ADB WiFi" defaultOpen={false}>
    ADB WiFi is a Android Studio plugin that allows users to boot programs to devices over WiFi. This makes booting code onto the robot much easier, but is still a bit finicky.

## What is Auton-First for FTC?

Auton-First is the development of robotics code that focuses on enabling easy Autonomous period design. Since Autonomous period is often seen as more complex than TeleOP, designing with it in mind provides many benefits.
