## Why a seperate class?

While creating utility classes with a small codebase is often unnecessary, as FTC code often resuses similar resources and can grow over a long time, it is often convienent to create some ready-made utility classes to simplify work.

In addition to providing pre-built functionality, utility classes can also greatly reduce the number duplicated code fragments and make large files more readable.

## What should I make a utility class?

In this guide, a few example utility classes are shown, Gamepads and Motor Groups. These things are often used as supporting functionality, but are not actual components directly used by the robot.
