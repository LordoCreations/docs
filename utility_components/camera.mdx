## What is Computer Vision?

[Computer Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision), or CV, is the use of various computer algorithms to process data from a vision sensor, which is often a camera in FTC.

To connect a webcam to the robot, follow [this tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/hardware_and_software_configuration/configuring/configuring_external_webcam/configuring-external-webcam.html).

## Programming with Vision Portal

Recently, the FTC Robot Controller has incorporated the FTC VisionPortal, which combines functionality from older [EasyOpenCV](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV) and AprilTag libaries.

### EasyOpenCV

**EasyOpenCV** is a vision tool that utilizes [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) to detect various phenomena from camera vision. For example, in FTC 2022-23 Season [Powerplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsitvZ0JaDc), three sides of a cone needed to be recognized in order to choose where the robot needed to park. 

Many teams used a three coloured cones as below, and used EasyOpenCV to recognize them.

While VisionPortal was not in the FTC Robot Controller during this season, similar functionality could be created using the library.
