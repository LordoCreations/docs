## What are Opmodes?

An Opmode is code that can be executed on the Robot Controller by using the Driver Station. They are executed in phases, from the pressing of the INIT button, to START, to STOP.

<Info>
  There are two types of Opmodes, Iterative (`OpMode`) and Linear (`LinearOpMode`). In the former, functions are called for each stage of running the robot, while in the latter all robot code is ran in a single function.

### Initialize

The initialize period called when the INIT button is pressed on the Driver Station. This is only runs once, and is generally used to set variables and configure telemetry and other apps before the robot actually moves.

In an Iterative Opmode, the `init()`  function is called when the initialize button, as shown below.

```java
public class IterativeOpMode extends OpMode {
	@Override
	public void init() {
		// initialize robot
	}
}
```

<Tip>
  The `@Override` tag is used to indicate that the function is [overriden](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/method-overriding) but is not absolutely necessary
</Tip>

In a Linear Opmode, the `runOpMode()` function is used to run all robot code. As a result, the function is ran automatically and initialization should be done at the start of the function.

```java
public class LinearOpMode extends LinearOpMode {
    @Override
    public void runOpMode() {
		// initialize robot

		... other functions
	}
}
```

### Initialize Loop

Once the initialize function is completed, a loop can be added that runs repeatedly before the opmode is actually started. Since not many actions require this type of initialization, it is rarely seen in most FTC Opmodes.

In an Iterative Opmode, the `init_loop()`  function is called repeatedly until the START button is pressed.

```java
public class IterativeOpMode extends OpMode {
	@Override
	public void init_loop() {
		// called continously until the START button is pressed
	}
}
```

In a Linear Opmode, a loop can be added after the robot is initialized to match the functionality of the above.

```java
public class LinearOpMode extends LinearOpMode {
    @Override
    public void runOpMode() {
		// initialize robot

		while (opModeInInit()) { // or while (!isStarted())
			// runs continously until the START button is pressed
		}

		... other functions
	}
}
```

### Start

Once the start button is pressed, this segment of code is ran once. This is rarely used in TeleOp Opmodes, but most Autonomous actions are performed here.

In an Iterative Opmode, the `start()`  function is called when the START button is pressed.

```java
public class IterativeOpMode extends OpMode {
	@Override
	public void start() {
		// called once the START button is pressed
	}
}
```

In a Linear Opmode, code after the `waitForStart()`  function is exectuded after the START button is pressed

```java
public class LinearOpMode extends LinearOpMode {
    @Override
    public void runOpMode() {
		// initialize robot

		waitForStart();
		// things to do after START

		... other functions
	}
}
```

### Start Loop

Once the start function is completed, opmodes enter a loop which continues until the STOP button is pressed. Most TeleOP actions are performed in this segment. Note that there is a small delay between each time the loop is called.

In an Iterative Opmode, the `loop()`  function runs repeatedly after the `start()` function is completed

```java
public class IterativeOpMode extends OpMode {
	@Override
	public void loop() {
		// called repeatedly after start() function completes
	}
}
```

In a Linear Opmode, a loop can be added to mimic the functionality of the above.

```java
public class LinearOpMode extends LinearOpMode {
    @Override
    public void runOpMode() {
		// initialize robot

		waitForStart();

		while (opModeIsActive()) {
			// runs continously until the STOP button is pressed
		}

		... other functions
	}
}
```

<Note>
  In earlier versions of the Robot Controller, there are slight differences in the implementation of this function. See [here](https://gm0.org/en/latest/docs/software/getting-started/linear-opmode-vs-opmode.html) for more details
</Note>

### Stop

Once the STOP button is pressed, this segment of code is ran to conclude any actions during the Opmode. This is generally not used since motors and other FTC-designed tools are automatically stopped.

In an Iterative Opmode, `stop()` is called when the STOP button is pressed

```java
public class IterativeOpMode extends OpMode {
	@Override
	public void stop() {
		// called after STOP button pressed
	}
}
```

In a Linear Opmode, a loop checking `isStopRequested()`  can be used to simulate the above function.

```java
public class LinearOpMode extends LinearOpMode {
    @Override
    public void runOpMode() {
		// initialize robot

		waitForStart();

		while (!istStopRequested()) {} // wait

		// code after STOP button pressed
	}
}
```

## Additional Functionality

In addition to providing control periods for the robot, Opmodes also provide other useful things, like access to gamepad input.

<Tip>
  Linear Opmodes (`LinearOpMode`) inherit from Iterative Opmodes (`OpMode`), so all of the following examples will use `OpMode`. Unless noted, the behavior from a Linear Opmode should be the same.
</Tip>

### Gamepads

In the FTC, robots are controlled with gamepads. Since up to two gamepads can be connected to a Driver Station, they are called `gamepad1`  and  `gamepad2` .

### Hardware Mapping

Once the robot hardware is [configured](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/hardware_and_software_configuration/configuring/index.html),  each component connect is assigned a name. The `hardwareMap`  variable can be accessed to connect the physical component with the opmode.

Generally, the format to connect a component is by setting the variable to `hardwareMap.get(variable.class, "name of component")` . For example, setting a motor configured as "motorTest" would be done like below.

![Motor Config Pn](/images/motor_config.png)

```java
DcMotor motorTest = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "motorTest");
```

### Telemetry

Telemetry can be used to display various information on the Driver Station (bottom right box), generally for debugging purposes. This is provided in Opmodes by the `telemetry`  variable.

![Ds Pn](/images/ds.png)

Generally, data can be added using the `telemetry.addData()`  function, with a name and value. Telemetry is updated on the console with the `telemetry.update()` . 

```java
telemetry.addData("hello", "world");
telemetry.update();
```

<Info>
  Note that addData can also use a [formatted string](https://www.w3schools.com/java/ref_string_format.asp).

  ```java
  telemetry.addData("time", "%.2f", elapsedTime);
  ```
