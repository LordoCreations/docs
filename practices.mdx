## Importance

While most FTC programs are not super complex, it is still best to follow best practices when coding. These allow programs to be more easily understandable and maintainable, which is especially important since robot code can often be passed on for a long time between different maintainers and are generally worked on by a team.

## Commenting

Commenting code enables much greater readability, and makes understanding code much easier. However, it should be noted that commenting should only be done where necessary to avoid cluttering.

```java
Thread.sleep(1000) // this is a comment

/*
this is a
multi-
line
comment
*/
```

### Javadoc Commenting

Javadoc is a tool that enables automatic documentation generation and is attached to files and methods. It uses special [tags](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html) and HTML to format, so links can also be embedded.

```java
/**
Example method that shifts all characters in a string by a certain amount
@param a amount to shift string by
@param b string to shift
@return shifted string
**/
private static String example(int a, String b) {
	String res = "";
	for (char c : b.toCharArray()) res += (char)(c + a);
	return res;
}
```

```java
package org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode;

import com.qualcomm.robotcore.eventloop.opmode.TeleOp;
import com.qualcomm.robotcore.eventloop.opmode.TeleOp;

/**
Holds all common code between Autonomous and TeleOP Opmodes
**/

public class Common {
    public static DcMotor frontLeft;
    public static DcMotor backLeft;
    public static DcMotor frontRight;
    public static DcMotor backRight;

	/**
	Initialize components with hardware map
	@param hardwareMap hardware map from opmode
	**/
	public static initialize(HardwareMap hardwareMap) {
        frontLeft = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "frontLeft");
        backLeft = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "backLeft");
        frontRight = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "frontRight");
        backRight = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "backRight");
	}
}
```
