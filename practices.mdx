## Importance

While most FTC programs are not super complex, it is still best to follow best practices when coding. These allow programs to be more easily understandable and maintainable, which is especially important since robot code can often be passed on for a long time between different maintainers and are generally worked on by a team.

## Commenting

Commenting code enables much greater readability, and makes understanding code much easier. However, it should be noted that commenting should only be done where necessary to avoid cluttering.

```java
Thread.sleep(1000) // this is a comment

/*
this is a
multi-
line
comment
*/
```

### Javadoc Commenting

Javadoc is a tool that enables automatic documentation generation and is attached to files and methods. It uses special [tags](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html) and HTML to format, so links can also be embedded.

```java
/**
 * Example method that shifts all characters in a string by a certain amount
 * @param a amount to shift string by
 * @param b string to shift
 * @return shifted string
 */
private static String example(int a, String b) {
	String res = "";
	for (char c : b.toCharArray()) res += (char)(c + a);
	return res;
}
```

```java
package org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode;

import com.qualcomm.robotcore.eventloop.opmode.TeleOp;
import com.qualcomm.robotcore.eventloop.opmode.TeleOp;

/**
 * Holds all common code between Autonomous and TeleOP Opmodes
 */

public class Common {
    public static DcMotor frontLeft;
    public static DcMotor backLeft;
    public static DcMotor frontRight;
    public static DcMotor backRight;

	/**
	 * Initialize components with hardware map
	 * @param hardwareMap hardware map from opmode
	 */
	public static initialize(HardwareMap hardwareMap) {
        frontLeft = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "frontLeft");
        backLeft = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "backLeft");
        frontRight = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "frontRight");
        backRight = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "backRight");
	}
}
```

## Avoid Duplication

Many components of the robot are used many times in various opmodes, and this can often result in long segments of duplicate or similar code. Instead, try to merge copied functionality into common files or classes.

For example, instead of setting motors in a drivetrain both in a TeleOP and Auton opmode, a common file with all motor initialization could be [created](https://mdssrobotics.mintlify.app/structure).

## Keep Relevant Things Together (Encapsulation)

Java, is one of the most widely used OOP ([object-oriented programming](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_oop.asp)) languages, and through the use of various classes complex functions can be simplified and code longevity can be increased.

This is especially beneficial when using Roadrunner, as it provides classes like `Action`  which greatly simplify [parallel autonomous execution](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0/actions/) and can serve as a base plate for TeleOP actions as well.

For example, since most robots include one or several linear slides, a class called `Slide`  can be created that contains both Autonomous and TeleOp functions like below

```java
public class Slide{
    private DcMotorEx motor;

    public Shooter(HardwareMap hardwareMap, String name) {
        motor = hardwareMap.get(DcMotorEx.class, name);
    }

    public class SlideUp implements Action { // allows parallel autonomous execution
        private boolean initialized = false;
		public int dest = 1000;

        @Override
        public boolean run(@NonNull TelemetryPacket packet) {
            if (!initialized) {
                motor.setTargetPosition(dest);
        		motor.setMode(DcMotor.RunMode.RUN_TO_POSITION);
                initialized = true;
            }

            double pos = motor.getCurrentPosition();
            packet.put("Arm Position", pos);
            return pos < dest;
        }
    }

    public Action slideUp() {
        return new SlideUp();
    }
}
```
