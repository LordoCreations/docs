## Drivebase

Roadrunner's original and prime function was to coordinate a robot's drivetrain to follow various paths using coordinates and various [splining](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0/guides/centerstage-auto/) and line movement.

Before Roadrunner drivetrains can work, they need to be tuned so real life measurements are mirrored in the code. The official guide for tuning and installing Roadrunner can be found [here](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0/tuning/) and [here](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0/installation).

<Tip>
  Since FTC fields use Imperial measurements, it is generally better to stick with Roadrunner and FTC RC's default unit of **INCHES** for length

## Roadrunner Actions

[Roadrunner 1.0](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0) introduces Actions, which are managed through Roadrunner and can be executed in parallel and sequence with other actions and robot movement.

See [this page](https://mdssrobotics.mintlify.app/structure) for an example of creating components with Roadrunner actions, or [here](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0/guides/centerstage-auto/) for a full example for FTC 2023-24 Centerstage.
