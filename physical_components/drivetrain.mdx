All FTC robots need a drivetrain, or something that moves the robot around. There are a few common forms of drivetrains seen in the FTC.

## Tank Drive

The most basic form of drivetrain commonly seen in the FTC is the tank drive, which consists of four wheels. Generally, all four are powered but it is possible to only power the front two wheels. Alternatively, robots may have six or eight wheels, but generally the maximum amount of motors alloted to a drivetrain is four.

The programming of these drives is also relatively simple:

```java
MotorGroup group; // have motors alternating left side/right side

@Override
public void init() {
	// initialize motor groups

	group.run(DcMotorEx::setDirection, new DcMotorSimple.Direction[] {DcMotorSimple.Direction.FORWARDS, DcMotorSimple.Direction.REVERSE})
}

@Override
public void loop() {

	// drive with left stick
	Double[] power = new Double[2];
	power[0] = Math.max(-gamepad1.left_stick_y + gamepad1.left_stick_x, 1);
	power[1] = Math.max(-gamepad1.left_stick_y - gamepad1.left_stick_x, 1);

	group.run(DcMotorEx::setPower, power)
}
```

## Holonomic/Mecanum Drive

While a tank drive is relatively to code and built, it lacks many important functionalities that hamper its performance in the FTC. For example, a tank drive is unable to strafe, or move horizontally without turning. Due to the high density of FTC fields, this makes navigation and steering difficult and can greatly limit a robot's performance. Instead, most FTC robots use Mecanum wheels, which basically make it so when a wheel moves, the robot is pushed at a 45° diagonal instead of moving parallel to the wheel. As a result, this allows robots to move and strafe in a 360° circle, enabling greater movement freedom.

Furthermore, holonomic/mecanum drives often enjoy greater degree of software support, by libraries such as [Roadrunner](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0) or [FTCLib](https://docs.ftclib.org/ftclib).

To program this, a bit of math is used.

```java
public class TeleOpDrive {
    MotorGroup group;

    public TeleOpDrive(HardwareMap hardwareMap) {
    	// initialize motor group in order left-front, right-front, left-back, right-back
		
		group.run(DcMotorEx::setDirection, new DcMotorSimple.Direction[] {DcMotorSimple.Direction.FORWARDS, DcMotorSimple.Direction.REVERSE})
    }

    public void drive(double x, double y, double r) {
        double theta = Math.atan2(y, x);
        double pow = Math.hypot(x, y);

        double xCom = pow * Math.cos(theta - Math.PI/4);
        double yCom = pow * Math.sin(theta - Math.PI/4);
        double max = Math.max(1, Math.abs(Math.max(Math.abs(xCom)+r, Math.abs(yCom)+r)));

		group.run(DcMotorEx::setPower, new Double[] {(xCom + r) / max, (yCom - r) / max, (yCom + r)/max, (xCom - r) / max})
    }
}
```

The method can be called by the opmode, and generally x and y are a single joystick's x and y axis (with y axis flipped) while turn is the difference between left and right triggers.

### Field Centric Drive

Another advantage provided by using a holonomic/mecanum drivetrain is the ability to drive field centric, where the control axis are relative the the field instead of the robot. To do this, the direction of the robot needs to be found, generally through the robot [IMU](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/programming_resources/imu/imu.html) (which provides data about the orientation and forces on the robot).

```java
public class FieldCentricTeleOpDrive {
    MotorGroup group;

    public FieldCentricTeleOpDrive(HardwareMap hardwareMap) {
    	// same as above
    }

    public void drive(double x, double y, double r) {
        double theta = Math.atan2(y, x);
        double pow = Math.hypot(x, y);

        double xCom = pow * Math.cos(theta - Math.PI/4);
        double yCom = pow * Math.sin(theta - Math.PI/4);
        double max = Math.max(1, Math.abs(Math.max(Math.abs(xCom)+r, Math.abs(yCom)+r)));

		group.run(DcMotorEx::setPower, new Double[] {(xCom + r) / max, (yCom - r) / max, (yCom + r)/max, (xCom - r) / max})
    }

	public static double getAngle() {
		// configure IMU first
        double angles = imu.getRobotYawPitchRollAngles().getYaw();

        double deltaAngle = angles - lastAngles;

        if (deltaAngle < -180) deltaAngle += 360;
        else if (deltaAngle > 180) deltaAngle -= 360;

        direction += deltaAngle;
        lastAngles = angles;

        return direction;
    }
}
```
