## Motor Components

```java
public class MotorComponent {
	private MotorGroup group;

	public MotorComponent(HardwareMap hardwareMap, String[] names) {
		
		// initialize motors (modify the following as needed)
		group = new MotorGroup(hardwareMap, names);
		group.run(DcMotorEx::setDirection, new DcMotorSimple.Direction[] {DcMotorSimple.Direction.FORWARD, DcMotorSimple.Direction.REVERSE});
	}

	public void setPower(double power) {
		group.run(m -> m.setPower(power));
	}

	public Double[] getPower() {
		return group.run(DcMotorEx::getPower, Double.class);
	}
}
```

### Slides

Most FTC games require some form of linear motion, which usually appears in the form of slides. Generarlly, the programming of most forms of slides is basically the same, with a single or multiple motors spinning to retract or extend the slide. For information about specific types of slides, click [here](https://gm0.org/en/latest/docs/common-mechanisms/linear-motion-guide/index.html).

Active Intake

Active Intakes rely on some form of roller or spining mechanism to pick up game elements. In addition to using motors to spin these rollers, intakes often rely on accelerating the motors to a certain speed. This can be achieved by replacing `setPower()`  with `setVelocity()`  and filling in the other parameters.

Additional Forms of Control

In addition to setting motor power directory, other common forms of control include toggles (on/off). This can be achieved through a boolean that is flipped when an input is modified.

```java
boolean toggle, state;

public void update(boolean state) {
	if (state && !this.state) this.toggle = !this.toggle;
	this.state = state;
	
	if (toggle) {
		// do x
	} else {
		// do y
	}
}
```

## Servo Components

Servos come in two forms depending on if they are continuos or not. While continuos servos act like motors (see [here](https://ftctechnh.github.io/ftc_app/doc/javadoc/com/qualcomm/robotcore/hardware/CRServo)), normal Servos have a certain range of movement and can be set to an "exact" position (see [here](https://ftctechnh.github.io/ftc_app/doc/javadoc/index.html?com/qualcomm/robotcore/hardware/Servo.html)).

```java
public class ServoComponent {
	private Servo servo;

	public ServoComponent(HardwareMap hardwareMap, String name) {
		Servo servo = hardwareMap.get(Servo.class, name);
	}

	public void setPosition(double pos) {
		servo.setPostion(pos);
	}

	public double getPosition {
		return servo.getPosition();
	}

	public void increment(double amount) {
		setPosition(Math.min(Math.max(getPosition() + amount, servo.MIN_POSITION), servo.MAX_POSITION));
	}
}
```

Robot Claws and "Wrists" are the most common servo components, in which the former can occasionally involve multiple servos. While creating a ServoGroup class is possible, it would be rarely used. Generally, it would be preferable to create two servo objects that move in concert.
