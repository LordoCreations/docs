    ## Github

    Github is a software versioning and management tool that enables easy collaboration and code base design.

    1. Go to the[ FTC Robot Controller](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController) and press "Fork"

    2. To share the repository with collaborators, go into the new repository, press "Settings", "Collaborators and teams", and add people or teams

  <Tab title="Android Studio">
    ## Android Studio

    Android Studio is the recommended IDE for FTC Coding, and uses Gradle to build and boot the entire Robot Controller onto the robot.

    1. Go to [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and install the latest version for your operating system

       <Note>
         If you can't install in Program Files or Applications due to permissions, try installing in less restricted folder like your User folder or Documents
       </Note>
    2. Once installed, run the app and press "Clone Repository"

    3. Install Git if needed (and restart Android Studio)
    4. Select "Github" and the name of the repository you forked
    5. If prompted, press "Trust Project"
    6. Go to Settings, "Build, Execution, Development", "Build Tools", "Gradle" and change the Gradle JDK to Java 17; press "OK" to confirm

       <Note>
         If needed, install Java 17 by pressing "Download JDK" and selecting Version 17

    7. To boot programs onto the robot, ensure the robot is either connected to the computer via USB cable or wifi using [ADB WiFi](#adb_wifi_tab), ensure "TeamCode" is selected on the top bar and press the "Run" or "Restart" button

       <Info>
         A disadvantage of using Android Studio to boot code onto the robot is that it can take a long time --- expect times ranging from 30 seconds to 2 minutes

       <Note>
         Sometimes, you may need to plug in your computer to the Robot Controller before the device can be connected to via WiFi. Additionally, you may also have to do the first install each time you open the app on another WiFi network to download necessary imports and libraries.
